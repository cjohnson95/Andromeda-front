This project is an early representation of a full starck Express, React, Node, and MongoDB application in the form of a cafe beverage ordering web app.
With this project, I wanted to mostly showcase my back end skills with express and trying to get it to communicate with my separate project that is the front end.
With my React side, I used several packages including mongoDB, Express, React-Router-DOM, etc. 
I have my components that are representtative of an SPA in in a single folder and I utilized linked routing to naviagte to the different "pages" of the web application.
I also have a services folder that is suppsoed to be for my api calls tp fetch data from my backend via various GET requests. The point of the back end routes, particularly my menu requests, are for them to connect to my mongoDB, where my array of menu items are stored.
From there, the user can view the items, their price, description, and name.
I used several resources including W3S Schools, MDN Docs, YouTube tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN959MKmmpg&list=PLpaspowtqj-f9-5g2Rc1dWm1n2_nNfIl6&index=9), a coding blog (https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-element-type-is-invalid-expected-string-but-got),
stackoverflow, and even chatGPT for code correction if I was missing something in my code, but just could not see. It's hard being your own QA and figuring errors or issues sometimes, even with all the googling in the world. It always the best resource in terms of accuracy, but it is better than nothing. 
I also used previous class sessions, particularly the mern cafe lesson as my project was somewhat close to this setup.
